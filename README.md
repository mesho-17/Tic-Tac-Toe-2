This is a command-line implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 game board.

HOW TO PLAY

Run the Python script.
Enter the name for Player 1 and Player 2 when prompted.
The game board will be displayed, showing a 3x3 grid.
Each player takes turns choosing a position on the board to place their symbol (X or O).
The game continues until one of the players wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or if the game ends in a tie.
After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' or 'yes' to play again, or 'n' or 'no' to exit the game.
